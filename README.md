#### Dataset Description (Shweta):


#### EDA:

- The Dataset contains `10,000` rows of dataset values.
- The Dataset has the following Columns: customer_id,credit_score,country, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member, estimated_salary, churn (Target Label; 0 - No; 1 - yes).
- We have around `7,963` rows corresponding to Churn as **No**
- We have `2037` rows corresponding to Churn as **Yes**.
- We have the ratio of skewnesss `4:1` for every 4 values of churn as "No" we have, 1 value of Churn as "Yes". Therefore, we could see some skewness in the dataset.

- From the correlation heatmap we could see that there is good correlation between `active-member - age`, `age - Churn` we need to take a look at more of the features more.


#### Goal:

- It is Imperative that the businesses take the right decisions and to maintain good customer base with good retention. This would lead to good business growth and finally affects the bottom-line for the company in the end.
- This dataset which contains the churn data, looks at tall the features which might affect the customer churn rate and by applying smart ML algorithms, we could actually help predict whether the customer is retained or could leave the bank. 
- Through this, we could help the bank identify `Focus groups` in-order to target them and help the banks retain these customer.

#### Hypothesis (Shweta):

- What are we trying to look at?
- Who care and what are we doing to address the issues
- How will you gain from the knowledge
- What do you hope to do it from the application.
