#### Dataset Description (Shweta):


#### EDA:

- The Dataset contains `10,000` rows of dataset values.
- The Dataset has the following Columns: customer_id,credit_score,country, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member, estimated_salary, churn (Target Label; 0 - No; 1 - yes).
- We have around `7,963` rows corresponding to Churn as **No**
- We have `2037` rows corresponding to Churn as **Yes**.
- We have the ratio of skewnesss `4:1` for every 4 values of churn as "No" we have, 1 value of Churn as "Yes". Therefore, we could see some skewness in the dataset.
